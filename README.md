# Why? 

## Why use Personal Knowledge Management?
Most Information doesn't come in neatly wrapped packages. 
Instead, our brains are regularly flooded with various streams of data, originating from many different sources. 
To better make sense of it all, practicing some kind of personal knowledge management (PKM) is essential. 

## Why use Obsidian?
Obsidian is a powerful and intuitive tool to document and interconnect topics you care about. 
By writing stuff down into a web of personal knowledge, you can gain clarity and also stumble upon serendipitous new insights. 
Compared to other PKM-tools, Obsidian stands out thanks to its focus on locally stored data, which enables offline work and keeps you in control of your data. 
Also, the beautiful visualization options and active community which already created over 2000 plugins allow you to customize Obsidian to your hearts desire.

# How?

## Obsidian Onboarding: Core Mindsets

1. **Start with Intent**  
Decide upfront what information you really want to track. Not everything belongs into Obsidian.

2. **Play to Obsidian‚Äôs Strengths**  
Obsidian excels at interlinked markdown notes and personal‚Äëknowledge workflows, but struggles with 
- highly structured data (e.g. relational databases), 
- heavy files (e.g. CSV with 10k+ rows) or 
- a huge number of files (slowing down around 200k notes as discussed <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/maximum-number-of-notes-in-vault/1509/24">here</a>).


3. **Sketch a Rough Map**  
Outline your note types, folders, or tags before diving in. <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/">Check the community</a> for complex needs - maybe someone has built a workflow or plugin you can reuse.

4. **Iterate Continuously**  
There is no single ‚Äúright‚Äù setup. Try something, assess, and pivot without remorse. 

5. **Aim for Balanced‚ÄØFriction**  
Build just enough structure for effortless retrieval, but not so much that capturing notes feels like chores. The sweet spot depends on individual preferences and purpose.
