 # Why? 

## Why use Personal Knowledge Management?
Most Information doesn't come in neatly wrapped packages. 
Instead, our brains are regularly flooded with various streams of data, originating from many different sources. 
To better make sense of it all, practicing some kind of personal knowledge management (PKM) is essential. 

## Why use Obsidian?
Obsidian is a powerful and intuitive tool to document and interconnect topics you care about. 
By writing stuff down into a web of personal knowledge, you can gain clarity and also stumble upon serendipitous new insights. 
Compared to other PKM-tools, Obsidian stands out thanks to its focus on locally stored data, which enables offline work and keeps you in control of your data. 
Also, the beautiful visualization options and active community which already created over 2000 plugins allow you to customize Obsidian to your hearts desire.
