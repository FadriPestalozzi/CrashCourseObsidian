# How to enable Anki Flashcards inside Obsidian?

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an open-source software to learn flashcards using spaced repetition. 

The [Obsidian to Anki plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianToAnki/Obsidian_to_Anki) allows you to export your Obsidian notes directly to Anki flashcards.

This plugin is particularly useful for students and lifelong learners who want to combine their note-taking with their memory training workflow. 

## Key Features

- Convert Obsidian notes to Anki flashcards in bulk
- Maintain links and formatting when exporting
- Customizable card templates

For detailed examples and configuration options, refer to the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ObsidianToAnki/Obsidian_to_Anki/wiki) and [community discussions](https://github.com/ObsidianToAnki/Obsidian_to_Anki/discussions).

## verify AnkiConnect is running

Anki-Connect runs a local HTTP server in order to enable other applications to connect to it. 

The host application, Anki, must be unblocked for this plugin to function correctly.

[open localhost:8765](http://localhost:8765)

## Extend Plugin with Regex to allow for several #flashcard sections inside single note

search term = "#flashcard"

```regex
((?:[^\n][\n]?)+) #flashcard ?\n*((?:\n(?:^.{1,3}$|^.{4}(?<!<!--).*))+)
```
